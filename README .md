# LPG Leakage Detection System

// Project overview and purpose
This project is an LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) leakage detection system that aims to detect gas leaks and alert users to potential dangers. The system uses gas sensors to monitor the environment and triggers an alarm if a leakage is detected.

// Key features of the system
## Features
- **Real-time Gas Detection:** Continuously monitors for LPG leakage.
- **Alert System:** Triggers an alarm when LPG levels exceed the safe threshold.
- **LCD Display:** Shows real-time gas concentration levels.
- **Connectivity:** Optional integration with IoT for remote monitoring.

// List of main hardware components used in the project
## Components
- **Arduino/Raspberry Pi:** Microcontroller for processing sensor data.
- **MQ-6 Gas Sensor:** Detects LPG concentration in the air.
- **Buzzer:** Emits an alarm sound when leakage is detected.
- **LCD Display:** Shows gas concentration and system status.
- **Relay Module:** Controls external devices like exhaust fans.

// Steps to set up and run the system
## Setup and Installation
1. **Hardware Assembly:** Connect the gas sensor, buzzer, LCD display, and relay module to the Arduino/Raspberry Pi as per the wiring diagram.
2. **Software Installation:** Install the necessary libraries and upload the code to the microcontroller.
3. **Calibration:** Calibrate the gas sensor for accurate detection.

// Explanation of how the system works
## How It Works
- The MQ-6 gas sensor continuously monitors the air for LPG concentration.
- When the LPG level exceeds a predefined threshold, the microcontroller triggers the buzzer and displays the gas concentration on the LCD.
- The relay module can activate external devices (e.g., exhaust fan) to mitigate the leakage.

// Possible improvements and enhancements
## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile App Integration:** Develop a mobile app for remote monitoring and notifications.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implement data logging and analysis for better insights into gas leakage patterns.
- **Improved Sensors:** Use more advanced sensors for better accuracy and reliability.
